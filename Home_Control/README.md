# Home Control 
## Control stuff in your house via twitter
This project is created to have Arduino communicate about things via Twitter.  
Right now it's possible for Arduino to know when it's getting dark in a space, and to notify me by sending me an @ mention. When I reply with a string that contains "Lights on", a LED turns on. When I send my Arduino a message that contains "Lights off, the LED goes off".

I'm looking to expand this project with real lights and a remote. Also I might add more functions later (like temperature for example.)
